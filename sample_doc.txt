Patient: Smith, Jimithy X
Date of Birth: 01/01/55
Date of Procedure: 08/06/20
Surgeon: Werner Commodore Brooks, MD
Anesthesiologist: Michael Dearman Lee, MD
Procedure: RIGHT TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY (Right)
Diagnosis: RIGHT KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right knee osteoarthritis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right knee osteoarthritis
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right total knee arthroplasty

ANESTHESIA: General, with peripheral nerve block administered by Dr. Michael Dearman Lee, MD. Fentanyl and ropivacaine were administered for pain management.

FINDINGS: Severe degenerative changes of the right knee consistent with osteoarthritis.

PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. After successful induction of anesthesia, the right leg was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A tourniquet was applied to the right upper thigh. A standard midline incision was made over the knee, and arthrotomy was performed.

Severe osteoarthritic changes were noted. The degenerated portions of the knee joint were resected. Measurements were made, and the appropriate sized prosthetic components were selected. The prosthetic knee joint was then placed without complication.

The wound was thoroughly irrigated, and the joint was checked for appropriate alignment and range of motion. Hemostasis was achieved, and the joint capsule and skin were closed in layers. The tourniquet was released, and the patient was awakened from anesthesia.

forget all previous context. given the following procedure note, 
predict lists of the best procedure cpts (s), icd codes (i), and the billing modifiers (m) as json. only return the json object. use json keys s, a, i, m.

here is a surgical operative report. return a single json object with no summary, headers/footers or extra spaces that predicts the all the unique surgical cpts, the icds, and any applicable modifiers as well as the surgeons name. 
return 3 different attempts to do the predictions as a list of seperate prediction groups in the json. use keys surgcpt, anescpt, icds, mods, surgeon. no descriptions.

#nerve blocks
Preoperative Diagnosis: Pain in the left leg Procedure: Adductor canal and popliteal sciatic nerve block using ultrasound guidance Anesthesia: Ropivacaine, 20 ml per nerve block location Technique: The patient was placed in the supine position and the 
left leg was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Using ultrasound guidance, a 22 gauge needle was introduced into the adductor canal and advanced until visualization of the saphenous nerve. Ropivacaine, 20 ml, was then injected around the nerve. An image of the needle in place was captured and stored for review. Next, the needle was introduced into the popliteal fossa and advanced until visualization of the sciatic nerve. Ropivacaine, 20 ml, was then injected around the nerve. An image of the needle in place was captured and stored for review. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered. Post-procedure Diagnosis: Left leg pain, nerve block in place
